This project is a simple way to protect your website from spam and malicious bots using an effective CAPTCHA implementation. With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I can create a randomized string of characters that is rendered as an image using HTML canvas. Users then enter the correct answer into a text input field to verify their identity.

To make the CAPTCHA more challenging for bots, I've added random colored strokes to the image, which can help prevent automated systems from cracking the code. If users enter the correct answer, the background briefly lights up green, providing a clear signal that their submission has been accepted.

This implementation is entirely self-contained and doesn't rely on external libraries or dependencies. It's a simple and straightforward way to enhance the security of your website while providing a seamless user experience.
